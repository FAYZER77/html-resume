    <h2>About Me:</h2>
    <p>
      I was born 3 months pre-mature with Cerebral Palsy and, if nothing else, that has taught me not to take for for granted the simple freedoms of life.
      Career and quality of life go hand in hand, and so a job is a personal thing. I hope to work in a team environment and to get to knows those I work with.

    <h3>Good Content of all kinds!:</h3>
    <h4><a href="http://nebula.tv/">Nebula: A content hosting site collectively owned by it's contributors!</a></h4>
    <p>
      I have some favorite contributors but I'd rather encourage people to find their own interests there! It is a subscription service, but the subscription
      allows people to produce video content that is honest, insightful, and often fun at the same time. It is free from the algorhythm that leads to content
      baiting and chasing ad revenue (content is ad free). The fee is also super cheap!
    </p>
    <h3>Good content on that dumping ground known as YouTube!</h3>

    <h2>And Finally: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@FAYZER0">My languishing YouTube channel!</a></h2>
    <p>
      I have a couple of playthroughs of games that I actually need to reboot at this point but I think my next project will actually be about my journey
      learning my way around Linux.
